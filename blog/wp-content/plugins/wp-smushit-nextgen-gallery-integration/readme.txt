Reduce image file sizes and improve performance using the <a href="http://smush.it/">Smush.it</a> API via the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-smushit/">WP Smush.it plugin</a>.

== Description ==

This is a very basic integration made by popular request: the only thing it does is smushes new images.

We don't use NextGEN Gallery, so anyone wanting more functionality (re-smush, bulk smush, etc...) is encouraged to dive in and contribute.

Plugin updates are announced on [http://www.twitter.com/TheCHANGELOG](http://www.twitter.com/TheCHANGELOG).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-smushit-nextgen-gallery-integration` plugin to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Make sure you have both `WP Smush.it` and `NextGEN Gallery` installed.
