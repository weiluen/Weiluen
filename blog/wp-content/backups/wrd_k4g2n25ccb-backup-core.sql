I would say that I\'ve acclimated, but acclimate connotes far too positively.  And lately, acclimation seems to be my personal euphemism for a complete and total identity change. But, in fairness, it\'s hard to gauge how much I\'ve changed while being here—who I was exists only as a sketchy outline, too transfigured by the nebulousness of time to ever identify in static slices. But I can still tell that I\'m different. I know that I\'ve been marooned from all the comforts of home, i.e., all the creature comforts, all of my friends, all of everything that I remember, for far too long to remain unaffected. Regardless, it doesn\'t matter. Here, there is no backwards; there is no backwards for a volunteer. You can\'t ever look behind because you\'re charging far too rapidly forward for the muddled image left in your wake to ever be worth consideration. What\'s left, the deceptively perfect simulacrum of home life, is never valuable enough to justify its possible incursion into your mind and its, consequently, immuring effects. No, you can\'t be backwards looking here. You have to blaze forward so fast that you know there\'s no hope left behind you—that hope lies only in what may come. And this is why you  try and befriend the giant lizards that creep around your walls. And it\'s also why you tell yourself that giant bug swarms flew into your house back home too.\r\n\r\nI had come here with the naive notion that I would somehow change my community for the better. No, when the score is finally tallied at the end of the game, it\'ll be sweet, capricious Thailand that\'s changed me far more than I\'d have ever dreamed of changing her.\r\n\r\nAnd even though I recognize this, even though I recognize that futility is in the augury of written stars, I\'m still hoping that my ambitions will return.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/water-world_mg_0828_v2.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55\" title=\"water-world_mg_0828_v2\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/water-world_mg_0828_v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here, I\'m reminded of a pithy truth that I seem to have forgotten back home:  self-actualization is awfully hard when you\'re struggling to stay afloat.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/wale-ambition-copy.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-54\" title=\"wale-ambition-copy\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/wale-ambition-copy-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></a>', 'Ambition', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '32-revision-25', '', '', '2012-10-26 07:00:28', '2012-10-26 00:00:28', '', '32', 'http://www.weiluen.com/blog/220', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),

I think it\'s important for me to set aside 30 minutes for self-reflection. I can jam out to some iTunes, reflect back on my week, and take a few precious moments to plan for the next week. There is no excuse.  It\'ll give me a way—possibly, the only way—to understand my growth in <em>dialogic</em> terms. The open framework of blogging also provides the added benefit of accountability. If I were to voice my thoughts only to myself, it would be significantly more difficult to identify moments of cognative dissonance, i.e., on a metacognative level  I understand that I have a systematic bias that prejudices my understanding. And this is probably dangerous, right? I think, on a larger, this is the very thing  that, in Proctor\'s <em>agnatology</em>, accounts for ignorance: we, because limitless information is now readily available, use information to construct \"knowledge\" around a scaffold of personal bias. I mean, this prejudice is even present in something as ostensibly objective as scientific research.\r\n\r\nI think the first paper that I ever had to read for Dr. Roux was Platt\'s paper on <a title=\"Strong Inference in Sience\" href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/146/3642/347\"><em>strong inference</em></a>. It\'s interesting that even scientists feel the need to develop ways for systematically rooting out conformation bias.  If anything, as you approach the margins of human knowledge, the value of consensus becomes increasingly irrelevant. It\'s often at this fringe where we find individuals ready to challenge our orientation of the stars; it\'s where we find the Galileos, the Einsteins, the Newtons, the painters of the universe. But I\'m digressing—you\'ll forgive my discrusiveness, I hope?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Week in Reverse:</h4>\r\nI\'ve been swamped. It\'s the first week back, so my counterparts and I have been trying to plan lessons for the next semester, trying to consolidate my projects, and deal with the looming vagaries surrounding the new bossman— In the coming weeks, because fate, kismet, whatever you would like to call the ever-weaving Moirai, hate me, I will also be tasked with entertaining my new mystery boss. In Thailand, this most likely means lots of meetings and dinners. It also, probably, means dinner parties where Mr. Walker and his Thai pals (Blend 285 and, unbeknownst to himself, the curiously named Hong Thong) will be guests of honor. But before you misunderstand and cough <em>entitled! </em>let me elaborate. This whole charade will  most likely require a level of Thai (language and culture) that would elude even a Thai-born incarnation of myself.  Oh yea, and incidentally—I\'ve mentioned  this before, right?—we\'re not really supposed to drink. This whole balancing act is going to be just lovely: I don\'t want to be seen as obsequious, i.e., caving into Thai bacchanalia, but I also don\'t want to be seen as gruff, i.e., avoiding the new Bossman and ignoring my community. Somewhere in this mess there\'s gotta be a lesson about yin and yang, right—like, something about balancing my goals and responsibilities? I\'m desperately searching for the positives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>Thin Strings:</strong></h4>\r\nIt is blistering hot in Thailand. And I have 2 thin, fragile wires keeping me from certain peril. But as long as my fan is spinning, I know that the combination of sweat—lovely imagery, I know—and scorching air being blown over my back will somehow eke out a win in favor of livable conditions. At least the sisters Fate seem to be enjoying their little dabble with irony: haha, thin wires are keeping my life in the balance, haha! At least if the fan goes out, I can take a deep breath and soak in the bucolic milieu of rural Asia—you know, with only small hints of burning trash and PAHs floating through my lungs. Keep me in your thoughts; this week, as you might be able to tell from my histrionic tone,  has been a bit rough.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>On a Completely Unrelated Note About Organization . . .  . </strong></h4>\r\nI told myself that I would start using <a title=\"Remember The Milk\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjW86Z\">RTM</a> (remember the milk) to organize my life. It\'s been somewhat successful. My migration from the usual Google tasks isn\'t quite complete, but I\'m finding that the added plugins are highly beneficial, e.g., using <a title=\"YAR Plugin for RTM\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjYCSM\" target=\"_blank\">YAR</a>, I\'m currently tracking the amount of time that I\'m spending on all of my activities; this lets me see a breakdown of my day in pie graph form.  And if you\'re one of those <a title=\"Wiki Getting Things DOne\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjYN0r\" target=\"_blank\">GTD</a> (Getting Things Done) fans, RTM is completely compatible. There are also some pretty sweet plugins that allow you to directly incorporate RTM into your Google apps, e.g., calendar and Gmail, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo yea, Tess, you might\'ve been right all along: maybe more structure is helpful?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_316\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"]<a style=\"color: #005580; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-10-22.54.44.jpg\" rel=\"prettyPhoto\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-316\" title=\"Tweety Bird\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-10-22.54.44-400x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></a> Tweety Bird[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'ll leave you with a picture of an adorable bird that flew into my room.

I can\'t seem to find any traces of the flood damage that was featured so prominently in my mind\'s eye—only modern cars and kitschy lights. I feel that the two Bourdain episodes that I watched back in the States, the grand summation of my prior knowledge about Thailand, may have, perhaps, created a singular story of Thailand for me.

I would say that I\'ve acclimated, but acclimate connotes far too positively.  And lately, acclimation seems to be my personal euphemism for a complete and total identity change. But in fairness, it\'s hard to gauge how much I\'ve changed while being here—who I was exists only as a sketchy outline, too transfigured by the nebulousness of time to ever identify in static slices. But I can still tell that I\'m different. I know that I\'ve been marooned from all the comforts of home, i.e., all the creature comforts, all of my friends, all of everything that I remember, for far too long to still be unchanged. Regardless, it doesn\'t matter. Here, there is no backwards; there is no backwards for a volunteer. You can\'t ever look behind because you\'re always charging far too rapidly forward for the muddled image left in your wake to ever be worth your consideration. What\'s left, a deceptively perfect simulacrum of home, is never real enough to justify its possible incursion into your mind and its, consequently, immuring effects. No, you can\'t be backwards looking here. You have to blaze forward so fast that you know there\'s no hope left behind you—that hope lies only in what may come. And this is why you, ever-optimistic you, try befriending the giant lizards that creep around your walls. And it\'s also why you tell yourself that giant bug swarms flew into your house back home, too.\r\n\r\nI had come here with the naive notion that I would somehow change my community for the better. No, when the score is finally tallied at the end of the game, it\'ll be sweet, capricious Thailand that\'s changed me far more than I\'d have ever dreamed of changing her.\r\n\r\nAnd even though I recognize this, even though I recognize that futility is in the augury of already-written stars, I\'m still hoping that my ambition will return.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/water-world_mg_0828_v2.jpg\" rel=\"prettyPhoto[ambition]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55\" title=\"water-world_mg_0828_v2\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/water-world_mg_0828_v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\"  /></a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Here, I\'m reminded of a pithy truth that I seem to have forgotten:  self-actualization is awfully hard when you\'re struggling to stay afloat.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/wale-ambition-copy.jpg\" rel=\"prettyPhoto[ambition]\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-54\" title=\"wale-ambition-copy\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/wale-ambition-copy-600x600.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></a>', 'Ambition', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '32-revision-36', '', '', '2012-11-02 05:18:48', '2012-11-01 22:18:48', '', '32', 'http://www.weiluen.com/blog/307', '0', 'revision', '', '0');

It\'s the first week back, so my counterparts and I have been trying to plan lessons for the next semester, trying to consolidate my projects (well, my projec<strong>t</strong>), and deal with the looming vagaries surrounding my double boss switch up. In the coming weeks, I will also be tasked with entertaining both my Peace Corps boss and my new mystery boss. In Thailand, this means lots of meetings and dinners. It also, probably, means dinner parties accompanied by Mr. Walker and his Thai pals: Blend 285, and, unbeknownst to himself, the curiously named Hong Thong. But before you misunderstand and cough <em>entitled! </em>let me explain. This will most likely require a level of Thai that would elude me even if I spent the next 100 years —because fate, kismet, whatever you like calling the ever-weaving Moirai In short, it\'s been rough, especially when you compound that with the stress of studying for an exam.

In America, we worry  about a dated power grid that could spell impending doom for the Northeast Corridor, but, here, I\'ve got two lines of unwinding cable that keep my fan powered on. No power grid problems. No worries. If there lies a luddite somewhere in the far-flung recesses of my soul, then he would probably—still, only in the quietest of voices—admit that not having technology can, possibly, provide some added value. At the very least, I can certainly take deeper breaths, now.

I think it\'s important for me to set aside 30 minutes for self-reflection. I can jam out to some iTunes, reflect back on my week, and take a few precious moments to plan for the next week. There is no excuse.  It\'ll give me a way—possibly, the only way—to understand my growth in <em>dialogic</em> terms. The open framework of blogging also provides the added benefit of accountability. If I were to voice my thoughts only to myself, it would be significantly more difficult to identify moments of cognative dissonance, i.e., on a metacognative level  I understand that I have a systematic bias that prejudices my understanding. And this is probably dangerous, right? I think, on a larger, this is the very thing  that, in Proctor\'s <em>agnatology</em>, accounts for ignorance: we, because limitless information is now readily available, use information to construct \"knowledge\" around a scaffold of personal bias. I mean, this prejudice is even present in something as ostensibly objective as scientific research.\r\n\r\nI think the first paper that I ever had to read for Dr. Roux was Platt\'s paper on <a title=\"Strong Inference in Sience\" href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/146/3642/347\"><em>strong inference</em></a>. It\'s interesting that even scientists feel the need to develop ways for systematically rooting out conformation bias.  If anything, as you approach the margins of human knowledge, the value of consensus becomes increasingly irrelevant. It\'s often at this fringe where we find individuals ready to challenge our orientation of the stars; it\'s where we find the Galileos, the Einsteins, the Newtons, the painters of the universe. But I\'m digressing—you\'ll forgive my discrusiveness, I hope?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Week in Reverse:</h4>\r\nI\'ve been swamped. It\'s the first week back, so my counterparts and I have been trying to plan lessons for the next semester, trying to consolidate my projects, and deal with the looming vagaries surrounding the new bossman— In the coming weeks, because fate, kismet, whatever you would like to call the ever-weaving Moirai, hate me, I will also be tasked with entertaining my new mystery boss. In Thailand this most likely means lots of meetings and dinners. It also, probably, means dinner parties where Mr. Walker and his Thai pals Blend 285 and, unbeknownst to himself, the curiously named Hong Thong will be guests of honor. But before you misunderstand and cough <em>entitled! </em>let me explain. This whole charade will  most likely require a level of Thai that would elude me even if I could spend the next 100 years practicing. Beyond that, have I mentioned that we\'re not really supposed to drink?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>Thin Strings:</strong></h4>\r\nIt is blistering hot in Thailand. And I have 2 thin, fragile wires keeping me from certain peril. But as long as my fan is spinning, I know that the combination of sweat—lovely imagery, I know—and scorching air being blown over my back will somehow eke out a win in favor of livable conditions. At least the sisters Fate seem to be enjoying their little dabble with irony: haha, thin wires are keeping my life in the balance, haha! At least if the fan goes out, I can take a deep breath and soak in the bucolic milieu of rural Asia—you know, with only small hints of burning trash and PAHs floating through my lungs. Keep me in your thoughts; this week, as you might be able to tell from my histrionic tone,  has been a bit rough.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>On a Completely Unrelated Note About Organization . . .  . </strong></h4>\r\nI told myself that I would start using <a title=\"Remember The Milk\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjW86Z\">RTM</a> (remember the milk) to organize my life. It\'s been somewhat successful. My migration from the usual Google tasks isn\'t quite complete, but I\'m finding that the added plugins are highly beneficial, e.g., using <a title=\"YAR Plugin for RTM\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjYCSM\" target=\"_blank\">YAR</a>, I\'m currently tracking the amount of time that I\'m spending on all of my activities; this lets me see a breakdown of my day in pie graph form.  And if you\'re one of those <a title=\"Wiki Getting Things DOne\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjYN0r\" target=\"_blank\">GTD</a> (Getting Things Done) fans, RTM is completely compatible. There are also some pretty sweet plugins that allow you to directly incorporate RTM into your Google apps, e.g., calendar and Gmail, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo yea, Tess, you might\'ve been right all along: maybe more structure is helpful?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_316\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"]<a style=\"color: #005580; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-10-22.54.44.jpg\" rel=\"prettyPhoto\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-316\" title=\"Tweety Bird\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-10-22.54.44-400x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></a> Tweety Bird[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'ll leave you with a picture of an adorable bird that flew into my room.

In Thailand this most likely means lots of meetings and dinners. It also, probably, means dinner parties where Mr. Walker and his Thai pals Blend 285 and, unbeknownst to himself, the curiously named Hong Thong will be guests of honor. But before you misunderstand and cough <em>entitled! </em>let me explain.

And I have 2 thin, fragile wires keeping me from certain peril. But as long as my fan is spinning, I know that the combination of sweat—lovely imagery, I know—and scorching air being blown over my back will somehow eke out a win in favor of livable conditions. At least the sisters Fate seem to be enjoying their little dabble with irony: haha, thin wires are keeping my life in the balance, haha! At least if the fan goes out, I can take a deep breath and soak in the bucolic milieu of rural Asia—you know, with only small hints of burning trash and PAHs floating through my lungs.

Here, I\'m going to try and explain what I have already done and what I plan to do going forward.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The website is not completely integrated. I\'m using CloudFlare as a fake CDN. I will need to work on optimizing the website by using CloudFlare settings.</li>\r\n	<li>This week I reduced the number of HTTP get requests (eliminated 7) by creating a sprite for all icons and using the CSS coördinate property to display images in DIV containers.</li>\r\n	<li> I have also compressed some of the PNGs on the main page (for a reduction of approximately 60-70 KB).</li>\r\n	<li> I have added the 700 weight to the <em>Open Sans</em> font at the top of the page. This, hopefully, should increase the cross-browser compatibility (particularly, with Safari\'s faux bold font rendering).

Here, I\'m going to try and explain what I have already done and what I plan to do going forward.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The website is not completely integrated. I\'m using CloudFlare as a faux-CDN. I will need to work on optimizing the website by using CloudFlare settings.</li>\r\n	<li>This week I reduced the number of HTTP get requests (eliminated 7) by creating a sprite for all icons and using the CSS coördinate property to display images in DIV containers.</li>\r\n	<li> I have also compressed some of the PNGs on the main page (for a reduction of approximately 60-70 KB).</li>\r\n	<li> I have added the 700 weight to the <em>Open Sans</em> font at the top of the page. This, hopefully, should increase the cross-browser compatibility (particularly, with Safari\'s faux-bold font rendering). I have not done extensive testing in Safari, so I haven\'t checked if this issue has been resolved by the inclusion of the 700 weight.</li>\r\n	<li>I have added Google authorship to the blog posts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese are some additions that I plan to do going forward.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I would like to develop a mobile version of the site using Jquery mobile—this should also help with my SEO rankings. I had strongly considered using a server-side script for mobile detection—PHP, but I have decided against this method despite its obvious advantage, i.e., older mobile platforms might not be able to process javascript. Many major websites are already utilizing Jquerry mobile as their main platform, so I can see no compelling reason to support legacy platforms.</li>\r\n	<li>I would like to create a custom 404 page.</li>\r\n	<li>I have started to incorporate rich snippet microdata into the main page. This, however, has not been picked up by the Google bots. I am trying to utilize the Schema.org settings, but I seem to have made an error somewhere.</li>\r\n	<li>I need to fix my bit.ly service. I suspect that CloudFlare has broken my short links.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTo end on a less technical note, here\'s a quick story about misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nLast week I was eating lunch at one of my schools. My co-teacher gave me a plate to eat off. So after I finished, she asked me if I knew how to wash dishes. Being too quick to judge, I scoffed at her remark—inaudibly, of course. <em>Who was she to address me with such an imperious tone?</em> I\'m no privileged American brat.

It\'s interesting that even scientists feel the need to develop ways to systematically rooting out conformation bias.  If anything, as you approach the margins of human knowledge, the value of consensus becomes increasingly irrelevant.

In Thailand, this most likely means lots of meetings and dinners. It also, probably, means dinner parties where Mr. Walker and his Thai pals (Blend 285 and, unbeknownst to himself, the curiously named Hong Thong) will be guests of honor. But before you misunderstand and cough <em>entitled! </em>let me elaborate. This whole charade will  most likely require a level of Thai (language and culture) that would elude even a Thai-born incarnation of myself.  Oh yea, and incidentally—I\'ve mentioned  this before, right?—we\'re not really supposed to drink. This whole balancing act is going to be just lovely: I don\'t want to be seen as obsequious, i.e., caving into Thai bacchanalia, but I also don\'t want to be seen as gruff, i.e., avoiding the new Bossman and ignoring my community.

At least the sisters Fate seem to be enjoying their little dabble with irony: haha, thin wires are keeping my life in the balance, haha! At least if the fan goes out, I can take a deep breath and soak in the bucolic milieu of rural Asia—you know, with only small hints of burning trash and PAHs floating through my lungs.

It\'s always been troubling to me that even scientists feel the need to systematically root out conformation bias. But to have scientific progress, this is especially important. As you approach the margins of human knowledge—the place where most research occurs, the value of consensus becomes increasingly irrelevant. After all, how meaningful is the consensus of individuals who only partially understand a concept.  It\'s only at the fringe where we find individuals ready to deconstruct the orbit of celestial bodies; it\'s where we find Copernicus, Galileo, those who blunt the sharp corners of the world. But I\'m digressing—you\'ll forgive my discursiveness, I hope?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4>The Week in Reverse:</h4>\r\nI\'ve been swamped. It\'s the first week back, so my counterparts and I have been trying to plan lessons for the next semester, trying to consolidate my projects, and deal with the looming vagaries surrounding the new bossman— In the coming weeks, because fate, kismet, whatever you would like to call the ever-weaving Moirai, hate me, I will also be tasked with entertaining my new mystery boss. In Thailand, this most likely means lots of meetings and dinners. It also, probably, means dinner parties where Mr. Walker and his Thai pals (Blend 285 and, unbeknownst to himself, the curiously named Hong Thong) will be guests of honor. But before you misunderstand and cough <em>entitled! </em>let me elaborate. This whole charade will  most likely require a level of Thai (language and culture) that would elude even a Thai-born incarnation of myself.  Oh yea, and incidentally—I\'ve mentioned  this before, right?—we\'re not really supposed to drink. This whole balancing act is going to be just lovely: I don\'t want to be seen as obsequious, i.e., caving into Thai bacchanalia, but I also don\'t want to be seen as gruff, i.e., avoiding the new Bossman and ignoring my community. Somewhere in this mess there\'s gotta be a lesson about yin and yang, right—like, something about balancing my goals and responsibilities? I\'m desperately searching for the positives.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>Thin Strings:</strong></h4>\r\nIt is blistering hot in Thailand. And I have 2 thin, fragile wires keeping me from certain peril. But as long as my fan is spinning, I know that the combination of sweat—lovely imagery, I know—and scorching air being blown over my back will somehow eke out a win in favor of livable conditions. At least the sisters Fate seem to be enjoying their little dabble with irony: haha, thin wires are keeping my life in the balance, haha! At least if the fan goes out, I can take a deep breath and soak in the bucolic milieu of rural Asia—you know, with only small hints of burning trash and PAHs floating through my lungs. Keep me in your thoughts; this week, as you might be able to tell from my histrionic tone,  has been a bit rough.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h4><strong>On a Completely Unrelated Note About Organization . . .  . </strong></h4>\r\nI told myself that I would start using <a title=\"Remember The Milk\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjW86Z\">RTM</a> (remember the milk) to organize my life. It\'s been somewhat successful. My migration from the usual Google tasks isn\'t quite complete, but I\'m finding that the added plugins are highly beneficial, e.g., using <a title=\"YAR Plugin for RTM\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjYCSM\" target=\"_blank\">YAR</a>, I\'m currently tracking the amount of time that I\'m spending on all of my activities; this lets me see a breakdown of my day in pie graph form.  And if you\'re one of those <a title=\"Wiki Getting Things DOne\" href=\"http://jh.weiluen.com/SjYN0r\" target=\"_blank\">GTD</a> (Getting Things Done) fans, RTM is completely compatible. There are also some pretty sweet plugins that allow you to directly incorporate RTM into your Google apps, e.g., calendar and Gmail, too.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo yea, Tess, you might\'ve been right all along: maybe more structure is helpful?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_316\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"]<a style=\"color: #005580; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-10-22.54.44.jpg\" rel=\"prettyPhoto\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-316\" title=\"Tweety Bird\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-10-22.54.44-400x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></a> Tweety Bird[/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'ll leave you with a picture of an adorable bird that flew into my room.

I think it\'s important for me to set aside 30 minutes for self-reflection. I can jam out to some iTunes, reflect back on my week, and take a few precious moments to plan for the next week. There is no excuse. &nbsp;It\'ll give me a way—possibly, the only way—to understand my growth in <em>dialogic</em> terms. The open framework of blogging also provides the added benefit of accountability. If I were to voice my thoughts only to myself, it would be significantly more difficult to identify moments of cognitive dissonance, i.e., on a metacognitive level &nbsp;I understand that I have a systematic bias that prejudices my understanding.

Here, I\'m going to try and explain what I have already done and what I plan to do going forward.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The website is not completely integrated. I\'m using CloudFlare as a fake CDN. I will need to work on optimizing the website by using CloudFlare settings.</li>\r\n	<li>This week I reduced the number of HTTP get requests (eliminated 7) by creating a sprite for all icons and using the CSS coördinate property to display images in DIV containers.</li>\r\n	<li> I have also compressed some of the PNGs on the main page (for a reduction of approximately 60-70 KB).</li>\r\n	<li> I have added the 700 weight to the <em>Open Sans</em> font at the top of the page. This, hopefully, should increase the cross-browser compatibility (particularly, with Safari\'s faux bold font rendering). I have not done extensive testing in Safari, so I haven\'t checked if this issue has been resolved by the inclusion of the 700 weight.</li>\r\n	<li>I have added Google authorship to the blog posts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese are some additions that I plan to do going forward.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>I would like to develop a mobile version of the site using jQuery mobile—this should also help with my SEO rankings. I plan on using a server-side script for mobile detection—<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/php-mobile-detect/\">the script can be found here</a>, but I\'m a bit worried about how the mobile platform will appear on differing platforms, i.e., older mobile platforms might not be able to process javascript. But many major websites are already utilizing jQuery mobile as their main platform, so I can see no compelling reason to support legacy platforms.</li>\r\n	<li>I would like to create a custom 404 page.</li>\r\n	<li>I have started to incorporate rich snippet microdata into the main page. This, however, has not been picked up by the Google bots. I am trying to utilize the Schema.org settings, but I seem to have made an error somewhere.</li>\r\n	<li>I need to fix my bit.ly service. I suspect that CloudFlare has broken my short links.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nTo end on a less technical note, here\'s a quick story about misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nLast week I was eating lunch at one of my schools. My co-teacher gave me a plate to eat off. So after I finished, she asked me if I knew how to wash dishes. Being too quick to judge, I scoffed at her remark—inaudibly, of course. <em>Who was she to address me with such an imperious tone?</em> I\'m no privileged American brat. I can rough it with the best, right? So—naturally—I shot back with a regrettably brusque \"of course!\" This was the beginning of my downfall.\r\n\r\nHindsight is 20/20. And in hindsight, I think that my defensiveness in conjunction with an incomplete grasp of Thai turned what was most likely a benign question and/or a genial attempt at assistance into something far uglier than was ever intended. Semiotics is funny like that: two identical signs can somehow signify very disparate meanings.\r\n\r\nI spent the next 20 minutes searching for the dish washing station. And when I found it, hidden among thick bushes, I was greeted with no dish scrubber—just my hands to scrape off the grime.\r\n\r\nIt seems that washing dishes in Thailand might be a bit different after all.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-19-12.53.31.jpg\" rel=\"prettyPhoto\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-350\" title=\"Washing Dishes\" src=\"http://www.weiluen.com/blog/assets/2012-11-19-12.53.31.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"589\" height=\"441\" /></a>\r\n<div id=\"yass_bottom_edge\" style=\"background-image: url(\'chrome-extension://khpcanbeojalbkpgpmjpdkjnkfcgfkhb/edgebgbot.png\'); position: static; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; height: 0px; width: 100%; display: block; top: 512px; background-position: 0px 0px;\"></div>', 'Technical Update', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '349-revision-9', '', '', '2012-11-20 23:30:32', '2012-11-20 16:30:32', '', '349', 'http://www.weiluen.com/blog/366', '0', 'revision', '', '0'),
